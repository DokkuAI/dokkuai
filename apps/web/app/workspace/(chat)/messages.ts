    {name: "DokkuAI", src: "/Dokku.png", content: "The two main reasons why the weather does not stay the same are:Atmospheric Dynamics: The Earth's atmosphere is constantly in motion due to various factors like air circulation, pressure systems, and the interaction of different air masses. These dynamic processes lead to continuous changes in weather patterns as air masses move, mix, and create variations in temperature, pressure, and humidity.Solar Influence: The Sun is the primary driver of weather patterns on Earth. Solar radiation heats the Earth unevenly due to its curvature and axial tilt, leading to temperature gradients across different regions. This differential heating causes air to rise, creating low-pressure areas, and air to sink, forming high-pressure areas, which influence the movement of air masses and weather patterns."}
